# staticIDE
IDE for statically typed Python

In order to run the program:
1. make sure that Controller.py, Model.py, View.py, TCA.py as well as programs/testFile.py are all in a single folder (where programs/ means that it should be in a subfolder called programs).
2. Run the file Controller.py with Python 3.6 or later (3.7 recommended)

If the user wants to open a custom file, they should 
press the open button and then type the path to the file in relation to the location of the 
program, without the file extension (.py is **necessary**)

Currently does not support Classes, since there is no feature recognising attributes (they are treated like variables)
