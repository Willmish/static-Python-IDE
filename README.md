## static Python IDE
# Project description
This project was made as part of my Computer Science NEA project for the year 2019/20.
It is an IDE for statically typed Python, and its goal is to keep beginner programmers from developing bad habits of not typing their variables when moving to other languages which are statically typed, such as C, C++, Java etc.

# Project goals

 - Have a working IDE with type checking capabilities and easy-to-understand error msgs
 - Cross Platform support (Linux, Windows and MAC)
 - Text highlighting
 - Python Interpreter integration, so the project can be run in the IDE
 - Easy file managment for projects of any size
 - Customisation of the colour theme and highlighting schemes
 - Intuitive GUI
 - Helpful keyboard shortcuts
 - OOP support
 - Option to disable the in-built static checker
 - VIM integration
 
# Using the program

1. make sure that Controller.py, Model.py, View.py, TCA.py as well as programs/testFile.py are all in a single folder (where programs/ means that it should be in a subfolder called programs).
2. Run the file Controller.py with Python 3.6 or later (3.7 recommended)

If the user wants to open a custom file, they should 
press the open button and then type the path to the file in relation to the location of the 
program, without the file extension (`.py` is **necessary**)

Currently does not support OOP.
