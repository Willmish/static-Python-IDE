# staticIDE
IDE for statically typed Python

In order to run the program:
1. make sure that Controller.py, Model.py, View.py, TCA.py as well as programs/testFile.py are all in a single folder (where programs/ means that it should be in a subfolder called programs).
2. Run the file Controller.py with Python 3.6 or later (3.7 recommended)

Currently does not support Classes, since there is no feature recognising attributes (they are treated like variables)
